<p>Khazull and Burkx, fresh from their most recent adventure had settled in at the pub to regale everyone with their tales of heroism.  Krysp joined their table to share in the ale, and the telling.<br /><br />
While deep in their cups that evening, the lads got to reminiscing about lost youth and misadventures of the past.  One such tale was of the Achatlan Lair.
This cave complex was not far from Veskal's Exchange, a merchant hub, where the lads had spent time as their parents carried out business.<br /><br />
This tale grew with the telling, as all good tales do, with each Dwarf stretching a yarn about touching an Ettercap with a stick, or no, with their hand... or even, says the Gnome, leading one on a merry chase through the surrounding forest until he gave up in contempt!<br /><br />
Well, what could anyone do confronted with such a formidable achievement?  Why, what any good Dwarf would do; finish his pint and lead an expedition to prove he could do better!  Thus began the scouting of Achatlan Lair.</p>
<div id=Achatlan><img border="0" src="http://thebeamers.ca/Achatlan.png" alt="Achatlan" width=150></div>
<p>Steadied by their mounts, the three adventurers approached the cave mouth.  They slew several wandering spiders which emboldened them for the journey ahead.  Finally they entered the mouth of the Lair.  If not for their drunken state, they might have noticed the air grow moist and cramped, as if the lair was swallowing its prey.<br /><br />Unperturbed, the party jauntily engaged their first foe who quickly dispatched the party, its wails of glee echoing off the cavern walls.  Regrouping, still afflicted by ale and not recalling the details of why they were reborn, the group flung themselves again and again at the denizens of Achatlan Lair.<br /><br />Slowly their ale induced fortitude began to fade and they approached the lair more carefully.  Krysp suggested he could cast an illusion on himself and scout ahead.  Khazull went with him.  In the depths of the lair, they found an army of creatures fortified against invasion.  It would be no evening jaunt to plumb these depths.  The trio retired to the pub, sobered by the realization.<br /><br />To succeed in this adventure, they would need their brothers and sisters.  So they began to put out the word for all to come! </p>

The air was dry and the sun hot on Skrillien Point that day. Fortunately the bulk of the work would occur below ground as that is where the Hunter's League has sent their apprentices for their final trial.<br><br>

Khazull was up early intent on scouting the area known as Kalendra's Coven which extended far underground just east of the Upside Defense garrison.<br><br>

Stealthily Khazull was able to make his way through the entire labyrinth going so far as to fetch back the tablets from the various halls that Master Vallerex, an apprentice of Kalendra herself, requested from within.<br><br>

His mind at ease from a morning of quietly navigating the tunnels, when the time came for Burkx to join Khazull so they might complete the task of dispatching the wretched abominations found in the lair, Khazull explained the layout and how to move about without disturbing the inhabitants.<br><br>

Confronted with the lecture on sneaking and patient maneuvering, Burkx exclaimed, "... but Ah'm a Paladin. We haven't that skill!". Once more, Khazull attempted an explanation, and once more it fell on deaf ears. Burkx did not have the same state of mind.<br><br>

They pressed onward! With their presence known at every turn, they had many setbacks. Still they pushed their way forward, Burkx laughing and taunting their quarry, "That's Paladin Stealth! Har!". Until finally they reached the abomination chamber where they made short work of its denizens.<br><br>

Upon their return to Neneler Jabifa, of the Hunter's League, Khazull and Burkx were made full members themselves.<br><br>

We are pleased to present, Khazull Miststalker and Burkx SledgeHammer each Of the Hunter's League!!<br><br>

<font face="Microsoft Sans Serif">

<br>The Gods, in their benevolence, watch over us with only a bit of weakness and amnesia should we venture where we should not; meeting what would otherwise be an uncertain end.<br /><br />

Regardless, Khazull would still rather avoid the scenario entirely - why play dice with the Gods? He has gone to great length practicing his stealth and ability to slide away from a foe when the outcome looks bleak. This gives him solace that he will continue to walk the world exploring new lands, and able to return to the guild halls to regale the Dwarves of his exploits.<br /><br />

It should come to pass then that Khazull found himself out with Strykar plumbing the much maligned depths of Khegor's End. While they had high hopes, the duo was somewhat light on experience for such an outing - yet how better to gain such experience? ... they venture forth! Down and down they struggled, the spiral ramp thick with web and spiders alike. A rhythm soon emerged with Strykar lashing out at the spiders from distance while Khazull would hide off to the side until they passed; pouncing on their backs and together making short work of their chitinous foes.<br /><br />

Finally the ground levelled out revealing to the Dwarves creatures made of sterner stuff; and more eager to work together. The first of these foe surprised the duo taking Strykar quickly. Aghast at what he saw, Khazull fled, losing his attackers in the webs of the ramp. Alone in the shadows Khazull awaited Strykar's return upon which time the duo revised their strategy to some early success. While these creatures would summon forth help, Khazull's poisoned blades and Strykar's skill with earthly roots magic outmatched the inhabitants of these depths; for a while. Another misstep left Khazull in the Shadows again careful to avoid unwanted attention while Strykar regrouped.<br /><br />

As Strykar returned from the third failed attack, Khazull resolved to go down with his comrade if it should come to that. These shadows had begun to grown darker and Khazull's dislike for relying on the Gods for renewal waned. As you might expect from the tone of this tale, the duo's valiant fight was ultimately cut short by the overwhelming numbers of those inhabiting Khegor's End. Both succumbing and being transported safely away.<br /><br />

Later that evening as he raised a toast to Strkyar, Khazull tried to recall the tale but the amnesia which always accompanied renewal kept the details from his recollection.<br /><br />

He resolved as he had before, it wasn't so bad to be alone in a shadow.<br /><br />

        <p align="left">
        Hey there folks,<br>
		<br>
		I just wanted to give everyone an update on our goings-on in Vanguard: 
		Saga of Heroes.<br>
		<br>
		Thanks to Longbeard Anvyl Oathspeaker (some may remember him as the 
		gnome Thanzit the Mad in Everquest) we managed to get the old guild 
		Stone &amp; Steel back under active member control. It was being led by a 
		longbeard who wasn&#8217;t actively playing yet and thus we weren&#8217;t able to 
		properly run things. If you wish to see who is online simple type /who 
		all Stone &amp; Steel in the chat window. Note that I am playing as 
		&#8220;Warfeild&#8221; there, and no that&#8217;s not a typo, someone seems to have taken 
		my name.<br>
		<br>
		During our brief time here so far we&#8217;ve recruited a number of excellent 
		folk who will all make great long-term members of our guild. One of 
		Vanguard&#8217;s strengths is its great community (as evidenced by the caliber 
		of new people we&#8217;ve added to our ranks).<br>
		<br>
		Also, we have decided on a location for our town and guildhall. It is a 
		nice valley surrounded by mountains, with lots of stone quarries and 
		even a few frost drakes flying about hunting for Dwarfs and Gnomes to 
		keep things interesting! There are currently 20+ plots available in and 
		around the area. If you you&#8217;ve always wanted to open a blacksmithy or 
		tavern, now&#8217;s your chance!<br>
		<br>
		We are fairly active, but it would be great to see even more of the 
		Longbeards wake from their slumber for this terrific adventure we&#8217;ve 
		started in Telon!<br>
		<br>
		Here are some nice features Vanguard offers, if you are still deciding:<br>
		<br>
		1. It is free to play, with some limitations<a href="https://www.vanguardthegame.com/free.vm" style="text-decoration: none"> https://www.vanguardthegame.com/free.vm</a> 
		(though the game is doable without a subscription).<br>
		2. Mentoring system for groups. So if you are more than five levels 
		above someone you can mentor down to their level to join them on their 
		quests and they still get experience.<br>
		3. Brotherhood system, allowing you to create a brotherhood with some 
		mates and share experience (even when offline).<br>
		4. Public (non-instanced) dungeons so you can run into other parties 
		adventuring the same area as yours.<br>
		5. Plenty of named monsters wandering the world who drop good treasure.<br>
		6. Appearance tab, customize your character's look.<br>
		7. Dwarfs and gnomes can play any class, and there are many of them!<br>
		8. Build houses, guildhalls and boats! Houses and guildhalls can be 
		grouped together to form a village. Housing is not instanced, so others 
		can be walking by and see your home in the world.<br>
		9. Four spheres of advancement: Adventuring, Crafting, Harvesting, and 
		Diplomacy (and all play a useful role in the game).<br>
		10. Complex and engaging crafting system.<br>
		11. PvP Public arena.<br>
		12. Flying mounts.<br>
		13. Tons of content and relatively slow progression.<br>
		14. Stone and Steel will be there!<br>

        Hear ye! Hear ye! </p>
		<p>
        The Dwarfs of Bordinar's Cleft and the Gnomes of 
		Mekalia have formed an alliance of the deep dark! This alliance of
		<font color="#EBE0C2">Stone &amp; Steel</font> is now recruiting Dwarf and 
		Gnome adventurers, tradefolk and emissaries of any beard length to 
		become champions of the underhalls and deep realms of Telon! All manner

		construction of our guildhall and town in the mountains of Thestra!</p>
		<p>
        Not since the days of Everquest 1 have we experienced such a sense of 
		wonder, exploration, and danger! Several dark and perilous dungeons have 
		we already seen. Several powerful and dangerous renowned creatures have 
		we crossed hammers with... and much wondrous treasures have they given 
		us. We have met several new prospective Beardlings and Braidlings in 
		this land and are looking forward to building long-lasting friendships 
		with these most excellent of folk!</p>

        This 
        past weekend Stone 
        and Steel completed work on their Dwarf Hold in Middle 
        Earth! It is located at <font color="#666666">5 Roaring Road, Hekksgrun neigborhood, Thorin's Halls 
        Homesteads.</font> ooc: Any members wishing to visit simply 
        go to their Skills tab and under Housing drag the Travel to Kinship 
        House icon to their hotbar. We still need to come up with a few names 
        for the Hold itself as well as and the bridge leading up to it. So start 
        brainstorming and bring it up at our next meeting. Currently the house 
        has been furnished to keep it from feeling empty, but feel free to stuff 
        personalized decorations in the commons area storage chest or send it to 
        me if that is full. We will work towards replacing the existing 
        furnishings with these items if possible. All clansfolk will be able to use both the decorations and 
        storage, noting the following designated storage areas:</p>


        <p>
        <font color="#666666">Main commons:</font> Decorations and Class-specific items.<br>
        <font color="#666666">Den area: </font>Tailoring, Woodworking, Farming<br>
        <font color="#666666">Thane's 
        room:</font> Jewelcrafting, Metalworking, Weaponsmithing</p>


        <p>
        &nbsp;I would like to thank the following clansfolk for their generous donations 
        which went towards the purchase, upkeep and furnishing of our Dwarf Hold 
        this weekend!</p>

        <p>
        In 
        honor of the Lord of Stone and Steel achieving his 38th season, the fine 
        lads and lass of the Hold put their gold together to commission a gift 
        of finely wrought set of Dwarf-Iron armor! Metalsmith Gormi took to the 
        forge to craft this wondrous gift and presented personally it in front 
        of the those gathered in the tavern under Thorin's Halls. To celebrate, 
        many ales were had as we practiced timing our ale-guzzling to get it 
        down perfectly, well almost perfectly... My thanks once again for the

        Nearly 
        three years have passed since&nbsp; Dwarves of Stone and Steel last set 
        foot in Middle Earth. Once again they can be heard talking of tales and 
        treasure in the Halls of Thorin, the last great king under the mountain! 
        On this night we were treated to the musical interludes of Orgid and 
        Ozgrim, and to the hilarious jokes of the Dwarf Lord after a few rounds 
        of mystery brew were served! Once the Dwarves could not take much more 
        of the brilliant wit of their Lord, they set out in search of a 
        guildhall in Thorin`s Gate. Thanks goes to Ozgrim for the picture 
        submission!</p>

        Today 
        we reached the milestone of guild rank 20 in Warhammer Online! With this 
        achievement the heraldry of Stone and Steel is finally revealed for all 
        to see! All may now look upon Spell-Eater, the ancient warding rune 
        crafted by Runelords of Mount Glander with awe. It has been a long and 
        tough road, but we did it. Well done everyone! </p>

            Are ya in a rush to get somewhere lad? A Longbeard shouldn&#8217;t have to 
            rush through any tale, especially a tale tellin&#8217; of the Stone and 
            Steel regiment. Now have a seat an&#8217; listen up, ya might actually 
            learn somethin&#8217;...<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#666666"><b>Warfield [OOC]:</b> </font>Stone and Steel 
            was first formed in August of 1999 in the game Everquest to be a 
            home for Dwarf players. Back then we were known as the Champions of 
            Brell, which was the Dwarf deity in that game. Since then, we have 
            played Dark Age of Camelot, World of Warcraft, Everquest 2, Dungeon 
            and Dragons Online, Vanguard, and beta tested Shadowbane and Lord of 
            the Rings Online.<br>
            <br>
            We remain to this day a Dwarf-only roleplaying guild which now 
            focuses on the PvP aspect of various games. The guild was originally 
            founded for Dwarf players, but over the years has narrowed its focus 
            to cater to Dwarf enthusiasts who enjoy PvP. Some may wonder what 
            the difference is between a Dwarf player and Dwarf enthusiast. Well, 
            a Dwarf player is by definition someone who plays a Dwarf. &quot;Got a 
            beard and a pulse? Great, you're in!&quot; That's not what we&#8217;re about. 
            Dwarf enthusiasts on the other hand are people who always pick 
            Dwarfs as their main characters, rarely, if ever, play other races, 
            know who Flint, Bruenor, Thorin, and Gotrek are, and generally 
            display the characteristics of being stubborn, loyal, and mature. 
            That's what we're about.<br>
            <br>
            Anyways, the guild grew pretty quickly in EQ (we had about 230 
            members spread across three servers back then). Nowadays we are more 
            focused on building meaningful friendships with fellow members while 
            achieving success at the &quot;end-game&quot;. To help accomplish this we are 
            very selective in our recruiting and plan to limit our guild size to 
            around 75-100 members. This is about the size where we feel a guild 
            can maintain its tight-knit feel while at the same time be able to 
            get enough members online to do some of the more challenging 
            content, whether it be PvP or PvE.</p>

            </font>All applications need to be done on our forums. We do not 
            conduct interviews in game. If you can't figure out how to register 
            on our forums or read the application guides posted, then that's a 
            bad sign right off the bat.<br>
            <br>
            Our application is pretty lengthy and the answers given are 
            seriously considered. I think we're one of the few guilds that ask 
            members to take the Bartle Test, for example.<br>
            <br>
            Anyways, if the application is deemed satisfactory by our high 
            standards, then the applicant (we call applicants &quot;Beardlings&quot;) is 
            invited into the guild in-game to begin their trial period and are 
            given access to the Beardling private forums.<br>
            <br>
            The trial period concludes for all Beardlings at the end of every 
            month at which time our guild holds a vote on prospective members. 
            Full members can vote AYE, NAY, or WHO? A WHO? vote is the same 
            thing as saying I never got to know the applicant. Get more WHO 
            votes than AYE votes and you're out with no chance to re-apply 
            (basically less than 50% AYE votes means expulsion). So, it pays to 
            be very active during your trial period. Now, if you get just one 
            NAY vote, then you're out with no chance to re-apply... you'd 
            probably also have your beard shaved and be forced to wear the 
            pointy-ears of shame.<br>
            <br>
            As you can see, even if your application is accepted after the 
            critical examination by the Thanes and the Dwarf Lord, you still 
            need to convince the Longbeards and Clansmen you're a worthwhile 
            Dwarf. </p>

            Our belief is that to feel part of a community the guild must hold 
            regular events (preferably with a consistent schedule). Also, the 
            guild shouldn't be too large that you never group with certain

            </font>I can't speak for the rest of the guild since we haven't had 
            a debate on the matter. Personally, I wish they didn't exist, but 
            because of poor game design, they do. <br>
            <br>
            If WAR ends up making it a requirement to use a lot of gold to 
            upgrade your gear or use rare tradable components, expect gold 
            farming to be just as rampant in WAR as it is in other games. The 
            best way to get rid of gold farmers is to make items and their 
            enhancements require personal time invested by the players to get. 
            For example, by doing quests or killing other players. Another 
            option is to make high quality items No-Trade. If you ask me, 
            crafted items are more likely to cause gold-farming to emerge than 
            say quested gear or RvR-rewarded gear.<br>
            <br>
            Stone and Steel wouldn't boot a member for purchasing gold. If EA 
            Mythic decides to make gold-buying a ban-able offense, then we don't 
            have to worry about booting players as they will already be booted 
            from the game.<br>
            <br>
            My personal feeling on the matter is that buying items or gold with 
            real money is a personal choice made by the player. Either they have 
            the time to gather the gold in game or they have a job that allows 
            them to afford the gold out of game. If you believe that time = 
            money, which I do, then there is no difference in terms of fairness 
            between the two methods to acquire gold.<br>
            <br>
            That said, the effects of the decision to support gold farmers by 
            buying their product have a serious impact on the rest of the player 
            base, such as spamming advertisements in game for example. This is a 
            more serious problem and I feel that the developer either needs to 
            curb the demand for gold-farming through good game design or 
            outright make it a ban-able offense to advertise, sell, or purchase 
            such services in game.<br>

        Our 
        very own Anvyl Oathspeaker was on hand at this year's GenCon and has 
        brought home some very good bits of Dwarf-related information about the 
        upcoming Warhammer Online (Fall 2007). He will be attending the event 
        again today and tomorrow, following up with even more Dwarfy goodness 
        for the guild in the evenings! The following is a brief excerpt from his 
        first report:</font></p>

        do capture the enemy leader, a broadcast message &quot;The King has been 
        captured!&quot; is sent out and you become a big blinking spot on everyone&#8217;s 
        ingame map. Additionally, there are buildings that you can sack in the 
        city. When you do, treasure in the form of weapons and such will spawn.&quot;</i></font><br><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="1">[<font color="#DEA12C">

        <p align="justify"><font size="1" face="MS Sans Serif">
        One 
        week had past since the Dwarven adventuring party's last trip to the 
        vast tomb outside House Jorasco. On their last visit, Stone and Steel 
        was promptly escorted from the tomb by a host of skeletal archers and 
        specters. They entered this time a little more prepared and knowing what 
        to expect, at least near the entrance... This time around they had a 
        veritable shield wall with fighters Gunthoren Grudgebearer and Kronis 
        Wildaxe, even the barbarian, Baldaran Stonebreaker, set aside his great 
        axe and bore warhammer and shield to deal with the vile undead who haunt 
        the tomb. They had brought a young rogue with them this time around who 
        went by the name of Gurnak Brokenblade. No treasure would elude the 
        adventuring party today. The Dwarves, still bitter about the missed loot 
        from last week, would suffer no mistakes from young Gurnak. The pressure 
        the he felt while picking a lock or disarming a trap was all the more intense with five 
        grizzled veterans breathing down his 
        neck. Warfield Goblincleaver oversaw the expedition and&nbsp; wielded a 
        great sword of frost that he managed to liberate from the tomb during 
        their hasty exit last time they where here.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="1" face="MS Sans Serif">
        <img border="0" src="http://www.stoneandsteelguild.com/archives/DDO_delerastomb1.JPG" width="778" height="354"></font></p>
        <p align="justify">The Dwarves did progress further into the tomb than they had 
        the last 
        week, though they quickly ran into trouble once again. Shields were 
        inadequate against skeletal mages and Warfield's great 
        sword of frost was proving to be ineffective against the 
        skeletons who were immune to cold and resistant to slashing weapons. 
        The Dwarven cleric, Anvyl Oathspeaker, was struggling to keep the party 
        healthy when Gurnak had been knocked unconscious by a ghast's flailing 
        blow. This left a spike trap still undiscovered until the Dwarven shield 
        wall set it off. Gunthoren and Kronis were both severely wounded and 
        would only be able to finish one last fight before their injuries had to 
        be tended to.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was then that Warfield gave the order to fall back. Gurnak was 
        carried to the Open Palm Inn where he and the other Dwarves could 
        recover from their adventure. Over a few pints of ale, the Dwarves 
        talked about their experience and vowed to return to Delera's Tomb one 
        day...</p>
